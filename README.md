# STM32-ESP32


In this project Im trying to make possible switching LED on STM32F103C8T6 using my mobile phone.

To realize my idea I decided connect ESP32 to STM via UART and use AT commands on ESP.

Code for STM Im writing using CubeMX and Keil.

To connect ESP to my phone I use MQTT protocol and MQTT broker HiveMQ.

Developing is in progress.

If u have any ideas please write me.
